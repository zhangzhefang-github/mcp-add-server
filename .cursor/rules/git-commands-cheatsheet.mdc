*   `git commit -m "commit message"`: Records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
*   `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

*   `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
*   `git push`: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
